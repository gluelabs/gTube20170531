## Starting Up

To install dependencies run `npm i` or `yarn install`

## Configure the API KEY

In order to use the app, you need to configure your youtube API KEY. You can follow the instruction to get one following this link https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started.
Once you get your API KEY you can insert it into `src\enviroments\*` files.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
